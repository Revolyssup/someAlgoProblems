// The game's main puzzle is a maze, in the forms of a 2×n rectangle grid. NEKO's task is to lead a Nekomimi girl from cell (1,1) to the gate at (2,n) and escape the maze. The girl can only move between cells sharing a common side.

// However, at some moments during the game, some cells may change their state: either from normal ground to lava (which forbids movement into that cell), or vice versa (which makes that cell passable again). Initially all cells are of the ground type.

// After hours of streaming, NEKO finally figured out there are only q such moments: the i-th moment toggles the state of cell (ri,ci) (either from ground to lava or vice versa).

// Knowing this, NEKO wonders, after each of the q moments, whether it is still possible to move from cell (1,1) to cell (2,n) without going through any lava cells.

// Although NEKO is a great streamer and gamer, she still can't get through quizzes and problems requiring large amount of Brain Power. Can you help her?

// Input
// The first line contains integers n, q (2≤n≤105, 1≤q≤105).

// The i-th of q following lines contains two integers ri, ci (1≤ri≤2, 1≤ci≤n), denoting the coordinates of the cell to be flipped at the i-th moment.

// It is guaranteed that cells (1,1) and (2,n) never appear in the query list.

// Output
// For each moment, if it is possible to travel from cell (1,1) to cell (2,n), print "Yes", otherwise print "No". There should be exactly q answers, one after every update.

// You can print the words in any case (either lowercase, uppercase or mixed).
